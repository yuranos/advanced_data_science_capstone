### TODO
Please watch the video and assign points as described below. For each item you find coverage in the video please assign one point.
    
    Data Quality Assessment

    Data Exploration (e.g. correlation between columns)

    Data Visualization (e.g. value distribution of columns)

    At least one Feature Engineering (e.g. imputing missing values) applied

    Selection and justification of Model Performance Indicator (e.g. F1 score)

    At least one traditional Machine Learning Algorithm and one DeepLearning Algorithm applied and demonstrated

    Model performance between different feature engineerings  and models compared and documented

Please assign one point for each item below which is properly covered in the ADD

    Why have I chosen a specific method for data quality assessment?

    Why have I chosen a specific method for feature engineering?

    Why have I chosen a specific algorithm?

    Why have I chosen a specific framework?

    Why have I chosen a specific model performance indicator?

Please provide a list of IBM Watson Studio Notebook permalinks GIST to your notebooks you consider as your data product

    Learn how to share a GIST of your notebooks

    https://github.com/IBM/coursera/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-share-a-gist-of-my-notebook

Please review the notebooks and assign points according to how many of the following items are properly covered

    The notebooks are clearly structured and documented

    The notebooks contain visualizations in the data quality assessment steps

    The notebooks reveal the overall data processing steps ETL->Feature Engineering->Model Training/Evaluation/Selection->Final Result

    The notebooks contain visualizations in the model performance assessment steps

    The notebooks show the answers to the questions defined in the Usecase

### Plan
1. Feature Engineering(normalization of values, etc.)
2. Model Definition(2 types)
   a. Select performance metric and measure it for deep learning and non-deep learning models
   b. Repeat for updated features
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Deployment
6. Prepare ADD(Architecture Decision Document)
7. Create a presentation video
